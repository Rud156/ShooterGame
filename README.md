# Temporal Odyssey

[Current Project State](https://github.com/users/Rud156/projects/1/views/2?query=is%3Aopen+sort%3Aupdated-desc)

## Gameplay Description:
1. The world should be a small but linear experience, similar to the levels of Dishonored 2. Events that transpire in one timeline can have far-reaching impacts in the newly established timeline, potentially altering the course of events as a result.
2. Enemies will require the player to be prepared to fight, as they will be of the 'GTFO' style with sections of the map blocked off and hordes of enemies to fight. Additionally, there will be two boss fights in each level.
3. The art style will be reminiscent of Breath of the Wild, but will not be a complete toon shader. Instead, it will be more low poly and stylized, providing an immersive experience for the player.

************************Rough Concept:************************

You are an important part of a team that is working to protect the world! These missions involve going into a time paradox and completing a specific task. The time paradox is a place where time can be changed and affected, making it different from the normal world. Depending on the mission, you might have to get something important and bring it back or save someone. Every mission is exciting and unique, so you never know what you'll find!
